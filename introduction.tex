\section{Introduction}
When a painter sets out to paint, she will probably use most of the available basic colours.
However, if she knew beforehand that she was only going to paint landscapes, 
she would fare well with a farsighted palette: greens, browns, blues, whites, etc.
Such is the nature of Reduced Order Models, 
to find a subset among the combinations of basic colours 
to represent the solution to the problem of interest.

In the context of this work, 
the basic colours are the classical mathematical Lagrangian finite element basis functions: 
generic, piecewise, with local support, able to represent most functions of interest.
Instead, the landscape palette will be ad-hoc:
problem-dependent functions with global support, 
good at capturing details only specific to landscapes.

Additionally, she will not need all sorts of brushes, 
simply the ones with the right thickness and width for mountains, trees and hills.
The brushes represent the algebraic operators that arise from the finite element discretization.
As with the colours, we can find a subset of combinations of brushes that suit our problem.
That is, we can find a basis for each algebraic operator to build them efficiently.

Finally, since she is a vanguard painter, the domain of our problem, her canvas, 
will be allowed to change in time as she paints.
The landscape colours and brushes we select will need to take this into account.

So far with metaphors.

\subsection{Purpose and Layout}
We are going to build and certify an
{Hyper Reduced Order Model} 
for a one-dimensional parametrized piston problem, 
whose movement is prescribed.
The adjective \mbox{\textit{hyper}}\footnote{
    Word-forming element meaning "over, above, beyond", 
    and often implying "exceedingly, to excess".
    From Greek \textit{hyper} (prep. and adv.) 
    "over, beyond, overmuch, above measure".
} is present because 
a collateral basis will be created for each algebraic operator,
on top of the one created for the solution space.
The model PDE, the boundary conditions and the geometrical configuration will be parametrized.

\subsubsection{Thesis Goal}
Physical problems with moving boundaries may require 
the introduction of a nonlinear transformation in the weak form,
to translate the PDE defined in a deforming space into a fixed, 
numerical grid.
\mytodo{Sketch: Jacobian transformation.}
This transformation can take many names, 
such as \textit{generalized transformation}, 
\textit{mapping},
\textit{boundary-conforming coordinate transformation},
etc.
% \textit{mapping},
It usually involves the computation of a \textit{jacobian} matrix $J$,
whose determinant plays an important role in the aforementioned transformation.

The elements of the jacobian matrix might be known explicitly,
if the deformation is known analytically and the domain is sufficiently simple.
However, if the domain takes arbitrary shapes 
(likely for real-life problems in higher dimensions than one),
or we are dealing with an FSI problem (where the deformation is part of the solution),
it is quite possible that we have to compute the jacobian transformation numerically.
This is likely to be an undesirable situation, 
for the physical weak form will become contaminated with additional terms, 
making it more cumbersome to implement and deal with\footnote{
    The discretization will not be formulated for the original variable~$\phi$,
    but rather for its distorted counterpart~$J \phi$.
    },
and the inevitable overhead in computational costs.

This overhead created by the jacobian is likely to permeate in the Reduced Order Model (ROM),
for in the context of Finite Elements, it is often built as a system with the same algebraic structure
as the departing Full Order Model (FOM),
albeit with smaller matrices and vectors. 
It might even be the case that we cannot completely uncouple the ROM from the FOM, 
if the problem is complex enough, or that we need satellite ROMs to compute efficiently the jacobian matrix.

Hence, to avoid all of the previous, 
we are going to track down a formulation which allows us to remain in the physical domain, 
whilst maintaining a perfect \textit{offline-online} decomposition,
making our reduction scheme reach the maximum of its efficiency capacities.

\subsubsection{Document Layout}
The layout of the document is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item in Section~\ref{sec:fom_definition} we define the Full Order Model, that is, 
    the model PDE and its boundary conditions, 
    mesh deformation and the associated Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation
    in the physical domain,
    both at the continuous and discrete levels;
    \item in Section~\ref{sec:rom_definition} we explain the details of the reduction scheme, 
    alongside with the system approximation technique (M)DEIM;
    \item in Section~\ref{sec:fom_calibration} we analyze the FOM discretization, 
    show convergence figures and solutions for the moving piston for different parametrizations;
    \item finally, in Section~\ref{sec:results_and_certification} we present reduction results
    and certify the reduction scheme with an efficient a posteriori error estimators via model truncation.
\end{itemize}
Before all that, we frame our work within the current body of knowledge 
with a short literature review.
Additional references will be done within the body of the document, 
where their appearence is more accurate and helpful.
