  abstract  = {A tutorial is presented on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which finds applications in computationally processing large amounts of high-dimensional data with the aim of obtaining low-dimensional descriptions that capture much of the phenomena of interest. The discrete version of the POD, which is the singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrices, is described in some detail. The continuous version of the POD is outlined. Low-rank approximations to data using the SVD are discussed. The SVD and the eigenvalue decomposition are compared. Two geometric interpretations of the SVD/POD are given. Computational strategies (using standard software) are mentioned. Two numerical examples are provided: one shows low-rank approximations of a surface, and the other demonstrates simple a posteriori analysis of data from a simulated vibroimpact system. Some relevant computer code is supplied.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses that the application of methods of statistical analysis and statistical mechanics to the problem of turbulent fluid motion has attracted much attention in recent years. It investigated a complicated system of nonlinear equations, in order to find out enough about the properties of the solutions of these equations that insight can be obtained into the various patterns exhibited by the field and that data can be derived concerning the relative frequencies of these patterns in the hope that in this way a basis may be found for the calculation of important values. The difficulties encounter are of a twofold nature: in part they are connected with the complicated geometrical character of the hydrodynamical equations; in part they are dependent upon the presence of nonlinear terms, containing derivatives of the first order of the velocity components, along with derivatives of the second order multiplied by the very small coefficient of viscosity. The latter feature is responsible for a number of important, characteristics of turbulence, among which are prominent those connected with the balance of energy and with the appearance of dissipation layers. These layer an important part in the energy exchange, as they represent the main regions where energy is dissipated.}

  abstract   = {We introduce improved reduced-order models for turbulent flows. These models are inspired
from successful methodologies used in large eddy simulation, such as artificial viscosity,
applied to standard models created by proper orthogonal decomposition of flows coupled
with Galerkin projection. As a first step in the analysis and testing of our new methodology,
we use the Burgers equation with a small diffusion parameter. We present a thorough
numerical analysis for the time discretization of the new models. We then test these
models in two problems displaying shock-like phenomena. Of course, since the Burgers
equation does not model turbulence, we next need to test our new models in realistic
turbulent flow settings. This is the subject of a forthcoming report.},

We employ the scalar, advection–diffusion equation as a model problem for this purpose, but our results are quite general and apply to time-dependent, nonlinear systems as well. In addition to global conservation laws, we establish local conservation laws which pertain to subdomains consisting of a union of elements as well as individual elements. These results are somewhat surprising and contradict the widely held opinion that the continuous Galerkin method is not locally conservative.}

The GCL condition governs the geometric parameters of a given numerical solution method, and requires that these be computed so that the numerical procedure reproduces exactly a constant solution. In this paper, we show that this requirement corresponds to a time-accuracy condition. More specifically, we prove that satisfying an appropriate D-GCL is a sufficient condition for a numerical scheme to be at least first-order time-accurate on moving meshes.}

A DGCL requires that these geometric parameters, which include among others grid positions and velocities, be computed so that the corresponding numerical scheme reproduces exactly a constant solution. Sometimes, this requirement affects the intrinsic design of an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) solution method. In this paper, we show for sample ALE schemes that satisfying the corresponding DGCL is a necessary and sufficient condition for a numerical scheme to preserve the nonlinear stability of its fixed grid counterpart. We also highlight the impact of this theoretical result on practical applications of computational fluid dynamics.}

An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian kinematical description of the fluid domain is adopted in which the grid points can be displaced independently of the fluid motion. This formulation leads to an easy and accurate treatment of fluid-structure interfaces and permits significant fluid sloshing and swirling to occur without producing excessive distorsions of the computational mesh. Several applications are presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed modelling procedures.}

We consider several popular discretization methods for the spatial approximation of the flow equations including the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite volume and finite element schemes, and space-time stabilized finite element formulations. We show that, except for the case of the space-time discretization method, the GCLs impose important constraints on the algorithms employed for time-integrating the semi-discrete equations governing the fluid and dynamic mesh motions. We address the impact of these constraints on the solution of coupled aeroelastic problems, and highlight the importance of the GCLs with an illustration of their effect on the computation of the transient aeroelastic response of a flat panel in transonic flow.}

  abstract = {A new strategy based on the stabilized space-time finite element formulation is proposed for computations involving moving boundaries and interfaces. In the deforming-spatial-domain/space-time (DSD/ST) procedure the variational formulation of a problem is written over its space-time domain, and therefore the deformation of the spatial domain with respect to time is taken into account automatically. Because the space-time mesh is generated over the space-time domain of the problem, within each time step, the boundary (or interface) nodes move with the boundary (or interface). Whether the motion of the boundary is specified or not, the strategy is nearly the same. If the motion of the boundary is unknown, then the boundary nodes move as defined by the other unknowns at the boundary (such as the velocity or the displacement). At the end of each time step a new spatial mesh covers the new spatial domain. For computational feasibility, the finite element interpolation functions are chosen to be discontinuous in time, and the fully discretized equations are solved one space-time slab at a time.}

A general and flexible framework for implementing partitioned solution procedures for coupled aeroelastic problems on heterogeneous and/or parallel computational platforms is described.
