\section{FOM Calibration}

\subsection{Artificial Viscosity}
\label{sec:results_artificial_viscosity}
As stated before, we included an artificial viscosity term in the final formulation,
to go around the need for more involved stabilization schemes such as SUPG\footnote{
Note that we could have used the same hyperreduction scheme,
since the approach is purely algebraic.} 
methods or others alike.

A value needs to be choosen for the viscosity constant, $\varepsilon$.
Initially, it was set to be the square of the mesh size, 
\begin{equation*}
    \varepsilon \sim (\Delta x)^2 \sim 10^{-6}.
\end{equation*}
However, a parametric sweep for different viscosity values showed that
this value, 
no matter how small, was introducing measurable damping into the system.

The actual value that seems correct, keeping the system stable whilst purely convective (at least for the time-scale for which we are solving) seems to be a much smaller one,
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon \sim 10^{-10}.
\end{equation}
In Figure~\ref{fig:artificial_viscosity_comparison} we present a comparison for these two viscosity values.
We show the motion of the fluid at the outflow and a phase plot, to ease the analysis of the correlation between the weak shock wave at the outflow and the piston motion.
The smallest viscosity value, $(10^{-10})$ leads to a convection-like phase plot; 
the shape of the input is distorted but the maximum and mimimum values honored, and the same path is repeated over and over.
Instead, the solution with a higher viscosity value (or at least the one that we thought would do the job) shows a diffusive pattern, reducing the extrema and changing its path on every pass.
\begin{figure}[t]

    (Bottom) Phase plot between the piston motion (x-axis) and the response at the outflow (y-axis) for the same artificial viscosity values.
    Due to the creation of a weak shock wave, the piston motion is distorted.
    However, only the smallest viscosity value ($10^{-10}$) presents a stable phase plot, going over and over the same path. 
    }
    \label{fig:artificial_viscosity_comparison}
\end{figure}
Luckily, the complete reduction scheme\footnote{
    Namely snapshot SVD compression and interpolation coefficients calculation.
}
seems to withstand such a small numerical viscosity term without incurring into round-off errors\footnote{If there were, we could always reduce the plain vanilla Laplace operator $\int \grad u \cdot \grad v \, \text{d}\Omega$ and scale it by $\varepsilon$ right before solving the system.}.

\subsection{BDF Scheme Convergence Rates}
\mytodo{This requires a more detailed investigation.}
The next concept we are going to look at to check the quality of our simulation is 
the convergence rate for the two time-integration schemes, BDF-1 and BDF-2, see Figure~\ref{fig:bdf_convergence_rates}.

For some reason, the BDF-2 scheme does not decrease at the expected rate of 2.
Nevertheless, since for the calculation of the mass defect figure a space integral and a time derivative are used, 
this could reveal a weakness in this specific calculation, 
rather than a bug in the overall simulation.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{research_project/piston/figures/bdf_convergence/convergence_rates_mass.png}
    \caption{Convergence rates for mass defect.
    The BDF-1 scheme decreases at the expected rate, whereas the BDF-2 does not.
    This could be due to the calculation procedure for the mass defect and not to a bug in the calculation itself.}
    \label{fig:bdf_convergence_rates}
\end{figure}

It is worthy pointing out how the BDF-2 scheme is actually superior to the BDF-1 scheme 
for most of the period, as we can see from Figure~\ref{fig:bdf_1_mass_plot} and \ref{fig:bdf_2_mass_plot}. 
However, for some reason yet unknown, in the neighborhood of the shock wave creation, mass preservation decreases,
rising up the average error.

    Mass conservation, visual comparison (top) and numerical error (bottom).}    \label{fig:bdf_2_mass_plot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameter Range}
For the construction of the reduced basis we are randomly sampling the parameter space.
Hence, we need to determine an acceptable range for each parameter.

To do so, we sample a large space and visually check each of the solutions.
Visual inspection reveals that certain solutions contain wiggles when a shock wave occurs, see Figure~\ref{fig:smooth_vs_wiggled}.
Naturally, wiggles were not expected to be captured by this simple model, 
so they must be due to the fact that the shock wave is becoming thinner than the mesh size.
\mytodo{Check for different mesh sizes for a configuration with wiggles.}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{research_project/piston/figures/wiggles/smooth_vs_wiggled.png}
    \caption{Smooth and wiggled solutions comparison.
    Each solution has a different scale and frequency because they were obtained for different parametrizations.}
    \label{fig:smooth_vs_wiggled}
\end{figure}
To prevent these unrealistic solutions from polluting our reference solutions, we
need to determine a safety margin in the sampling range prevent using a parametrization for which wiggles will take place.


\subsubsection{System Forcing And Nonlinear Response}
On the one hand, when we think about the equations and their response, we could hint at the fact that shock wave strength will be driven by the magnitude of the piston's velocity.
This variable, although time dependent, is scaled by the combination of the speed of sound,
piston frequency and displacement, 
namely the piston peak velocity
\begin{equation}
    u_p \sim \frac{\delta \omega L_0}{a_0}.
\end{equation}
Such peak velocity will be maximum (minimum) for maximum (minimum) values of displacement and frequency, and minimum (maximum) values for the speed of sound.

On the other hand, we need a procedure to quantify the nonlinearity of the system response.
In the absence of the nonlinear term, the equations would reduce to a linear convection model.
In such model we would expect the piston motion to be perfectly convected towards the outflow.
But due to the presence of the nonlinear term, we know this will not be the case.
Hence, we suggest and use as a nonlinearity metric $\eta$ the ratio between the time between two peaks at the ouflow and the piston,
\begin{equation}
    \eta := \frac{T}{T_0},
\end{equation}
where $T$ and $T_0$ are respectively defined as
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        T_0 &:= t^{L}_{+} - t^{L}_{-},
        \\
        T   &:= t^{\text{out}}_{+} - t^{\text{out}}_{-}.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
The symbols $t^{(\cdot)}_{+}$ and $t^{(\cdot)}_{-}$ denote the first positive and the second\footnote{We take the second negative peak and not the first one to remove any possible distortion due to the initial transient from rest to harmonic movement.} negative peaks in the velocity function at their respective locations.

The closer $\eta$ is to one, the more linear the response is.
As it tends to zero, the response is becoming nonlinear, 
since a shock wave is building up at the outflow;
\begin{align*}
    &\eta \sim 1 : \text{Linear response}, 
    \\
    &\eta \rightarrow 0 : \text{Nonlinear response}.
\end{align*}
In Figure~\ref{fig:wiggle_correlation} we show the response of the system for different parametrization values, alongside with the forcing $u_p$ and nonlinearity measure $\eta$. 
We have manually tagged which combinations present wiggles.
There are several observations to be made about this pair plot.

First of all, looking the raw parameters $a_0, \omega$ and $\delta$, we observe how 
none of them individually explain how nonlinear the response of the system will be.
There is certainly a trend, low values of $a_0$ and large values of $\delta$ and $\omega$ contain wiggles (as shown by the density plots). 
However, points with low values of $a_0$ belong to the set without wiggles too. 
Therefore, it must be the combination of them which explains the existence of wiggles.

When we look at the correlation between~$u_p$ and~$\eta$, we observe a linear trend between them: the higher the forcing, the stronger the nonlinearity in the response.
And clearly, beyond a threshold in the forcing, the system seems to break and most solutions contain wiggles.
This critical value~$u_M$ for the forcing seems to be in the neighborhood of~$u_M \sim 0.4$. 

With this empirical study of the system's response (and after running some tests) we choose the following ranges for our parameters:
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Acceptable parameter range for random sampling. This configuration should prevent the existence of wiggles at the outflow.}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
        Variable  & Minimum & Maximum & Units 
        \\ \midrule
        $a_0$     & 18      & 25      & m/s \\
        $\omega$  & 15      & 30      & 1/s \\
        $\delta$  & 0.15    & 0.3     & [-]
        \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

% \end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Conclusions}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The scheme seems consistent in the time variable, for the smaller we make the timestep, 
%     the smaller the error in the conservation of mass, as shown by Figure~\ref{fig:l2_vs_dt}.
%     \item Figures~\ref{fig:comparison_bdf} and \ref{fig:comparison_bdf_zoom} show a comparison between two time marching schemes.
%     The BDF-2 scheme seems to capture better the dynamics, for the only part where the outflow is different from the density time variation is near the upper peak. 
%     \item The fact that we do not see a slop of order two in Figure~\ref{fig:l2_vs_dt} could be due to the nature of the variable we are measuring, not necessarily a bug.
%         \begin{itemize}
%             \item According to Figure~\ref{fig:comparison_bdf_zoom}, the BDF-2 scheme captures better the dynamic of mass conservation.
%             \item The L2 errors is computed as the difference between outflow and mass variation, divided by $N_t$. 
%             I think that is the reason we see the same slope twice, because we are seeing $dt~\sim N_t^{-1}$ vs. $N_t^{-1}$
%             (and yet, the BDF-2 curve is underneath the BDF-1).

% \subsection{System Approximation: DEIM and MDEIM}
% Due to the simplicity of the geometry (1D piston), the linear operators are reduced effortlessly.
% We recall that to build the collateral space (the basis for the algebraic operators), we are using a nested POD approach:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Select parameter, assemble in time, compress, collect basis.
%     \item Update parameter, repeat assembly and compression in time.
%     \item Compress all the collected basis for each parameter.
% \end{enumerate}

%     \end{tabular}
%     \label{tab:summary_basis_deim}
% \end{table}
% As we can see in Table~\ref{tab:summary_basis_deim}, linear operators can be resolved by a few number of basis.
% This is so because their main nonlinearity is the implicit jacobian which is present due to the time-dependency of the domain.
% Since it is a very simple domain (1D piston), the jacobian is a function of time and space,
% \begin{equation}
%     J \sim L'(t) x,
% \end{equation}
% so its reduction is immediate. 

% The RHS requires a bit more of terms because it contains the action of all the operators unto the lifting function.

% \subsubsection{Nonlinear term}
% To assemble the nonlinear term, we use the reduced basis modes as a proxy for the actual solution which is used in the discretization.
% This is a fair approach, since eventually the solution will be a linear combination of such modes.
% Thus, the number of basis after the tree walk depends not only in the number of parameters, but also in the number of reduced basis elements.
% Again, a three-level nested POD approach is used:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item For a given parameter, for each timestep:
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item Assemble for each basis element, compress, collect.
%         \item Update time, repeat assemly and compression in reduced basis space.
%     \end{enumerate}
%     \item Update parameter, repeat assembly and compression in time.
%     \item Compress all the collected basis for each parameter.
% \end{enumerate}
% A very decent reduction ratio can be achieved.

% \subsubsection{Online errors}
% With the collateral basis, we sample unseen parameters and assemble the operators to evaluate our collateral basis.
% As expected given the simplicity of the implicit nonlinearity, they are reconstruced to machine accuracy, as shown 
% in Figures~\ref{fig:online_rhs}, \ref{fig:online_mass_errors}, \ref{fig:online_stiffness_errors}, \ref{fig:online_convection_errors},

%     \item Update parameter, repeat solution and compression in time.
%     \item Compress all the collected basis for each parameter.
% \end{itemize}
% All the parameters are selected probing an uniformly distributed random variable, see Figure~\ref{fig:mu_space}.

% We ran three tests:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item \textbf{Benchmark}: automatic basis selection, all basis elements whose singular values are $\sigma > 10^{-7}$ are kept.
%     This is the most complete reduced basis one can get.
%     \item \textbf{Half-Space} (Fix tolerance in the parameter space for the solution and the nonlinear term): 
%     we keep all the basis elements which explain up 50\% of the variance. This is a strong reduction criteria.
%     \item \textbf{Reduced Solution Space}: we keep the automatic basis selection for the collateral basis (algebraic operators) 
%     and maintain the 50\% criteria for the reduced basis. 
% \end{enumerate}
% For each of them we ran the ROM unto the training parameter set and the online set, which was never seen before.

% \subsection{Conclusions}
% Regarding discretization:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item BDF-2 is a must (even higher order terms should be considered). 
%     It allows the reduction of timesteps to use, which speeds up the offline stage,
%     which is already quite heavy.
%     By introducing such scheme, for $t\in[0, 1.0]$, I could go from $Nt = 1000$ to $Nt = 500$, 
%     which reduced the offline to about an hour instead of two/three hours.
% \end{itemize}

% Regarding model reduction:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The model captures correctly nonlinearities.
%     \item Linear operators are so simple a few collateral basis elements are enough to reduce them. 
%     This is due to the simplicity of the jacobian transformation between moving and reference domains.
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item No point in playing with the tolerances for linear operators.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Reduction of the nonlinear term is a costly operation, because the integral of the basis elements cannot be efficiently computed due to its global support.
%     \item If collateral basis elements for the nonlinear operator are neglected, the solution loses its physical accuracy.
%     \item The reduced basis can be trimed without affecting too much the solution (not as much as the nonlinear operator).
%     \item It would be interesting to have analytical results about the relation between parameter space tolarence and online errors.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Future Work}
% With this work so far we have proved that the ROM with reduced basis for the solution \textit{and} the operators in moving domains works.

% There is one flaw though, we can only assess the bondness of the ROM by computing the FOM solution too for the same parametrization.
% This makes it cumbersome, since we would like to compute the error without having to compute the FOM solution too.

% There are two possible paths now:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Extend the same procedure to a 2D domain.
%     \item Certify the ROM with the development of \textit{a posteriori} error computations.
% \end{itemize}

% Calculation for a 2D domain is more number-crunching and coding work, no new knowledge will be learned.
% Bug prone, non-mathematical work overhead (implementation details).
% If achieved, none of the models are certified: online errors can only be computed by solving the FOM problem too.
% Adds to the body of knowledge in a can-be-done way, not learning anything we cannot learn from the 1D problem
% about the implementation details. 

% Calculation of a posteriori error computation requires error bounds and the extension of some offline structures.
% More uncertainty is involved, but it gives actual closure to the ROM problem.
% Mathematical work, adds to the body of knowledge.

% \subsubsection{Extension to 2D}
% Extension of the procedure to a 2D setting would require:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Construction of a FOM solver. Requirements:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item To build the final algebraic operator by the sum of diverse operators.
%         \item To be semi-implicit. 
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Rewriting the (M)DEIM reductors, they assume a 1D setting.
%     \item Module to create harmonic extensions for lifting and mesh displacement.
%     \item Updating the move mesh module. Right now it simply scales the mesh.
%     \item Learning to use Paraview to plot the solution.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{ROM Certification: A Posteriori Errors}
% There is previous work on time-dependent matrices for fixed domains.

% A posteriori errors would require:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Construction of Rietz reprensentant.
%     \item Calculation of eigenvalues.
%     \item Literature reading.
% \end{itemize}
