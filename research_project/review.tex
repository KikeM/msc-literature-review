Reduced Order Model for Moving Domain
Black-box approach: minimize weak form manipulation
Adding forcing terms is alright
Modifying convective velocities is ok too

Finite Element Method
ROM: Reduced Basis

Problem setting
Midway between FSI
Prescribed motion of the boundary
Account for domain deformation
Full FSI problem would only mean additional basis and equations to solve


ALE methods

Boundary conforming grid
Physical and reference domain
Jacobians
    Difficult to compute
    Strong modification of the weak forms
Solve the problem in the physical domain
