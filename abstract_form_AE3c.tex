We present a Reduced Order Model (ROM) for a one-dimensional gas dynamics problem: the isentropic piston.
The PDE, the geometrical definition of the moving boundary, and the boundary conditions are parametrized.
The Full Order Model is obtained with a Galerkin Finite Element discretization,under the Arbitrary-Lagrangian formulation (ALE). An artificial viscosity term is included. The Reduced Basis is obtained with the classical POD technique.
To overcome the explicit use of the Jacobian transformation, a system approximation technique is used.
The (Matrix) Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method allows usto work with a weak form defined in the physical domainwhilst maintaining anefficient assembly for the algebraic operators.
All in all, our approach to the construction of the Reduced Order Model is purely algebraicand makes no use of Full Order structures, achieving a perfect offline-online split. A posteriori error estimators, obtained via model truncation, are used to certify the model.
